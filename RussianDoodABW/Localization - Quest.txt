training_wayoftheblade1_description,,Quest Info,New,"Pick up a bone and craft yourself a Boneshiv. Quite handy for slashing and harvesting meat!",,,,
training_wayoftheblade2_description,,Quest Info,New,"Now that you have the Boneshiv... get to killing. Aim for the head!",,,,
training_wayoftheblade3_description,,Quest Info,New,"Let's face it, the Boneshiv kinda sucks... Good news though, you have a better understanding of blades after killing a few Zomberts. Just enough to make one out of Iron.",,,,
training_wayoftheblade4_description,,Quest Info,New,"Not bad eh? Test it out on a few more Zomberts! You may learn even more about blades",,,,
training_wayoftheblade5_description,,Quest Info,New,"Sweet! I think you have a pretty good handle on wielding a blade. Go on and make a sharper and more efficient knife with the knowledge you gained.",,,,
training_wayoftheblade6_description,,Quest Info,New,"Oooooo, shiny! Looks like it can slice preeeeetty good. Super light and quick too. Well I have great way to see how well it performs.... KILL MORE ZOMBIES!!!",,,,
training_wayoftheblade7_description,,Quest Info,New,"That was fun and it went through the Zomberts like butter! But notice you need to get fairly close and personal hit them. Luckily, this killing spree gave you another blade concept... The MACHETE!",,,,
training_wayoftheblade8_description,,Quest Info,New,"Ah yeah! Looking pretty badass with that Machete. You know what you gotta do now, don't you?\n\nDood, I shouldn't have to tell you. Make them undead, dead again!",,,,
training_wayoftheblade9_description,,Quest Info,New,"The Machete is a nice heavy blade that carries momentum when slicing through Zombies. Only problem is it's lackluster in speed and sharpness. I think something lighter, sharper and stronger would be better... THAT'S IT!!! The Japanese Katana. Take a shot at making the Survivor's Katana.",,,,
training_wayoftheblade10_description,,Quest Info,New,"Holy crap... that is one fancy looking Katana. The thing is so sharp it looks like it will dismember any body part with ease. Only thing left to do now is to master it. Have fun!,,,,
